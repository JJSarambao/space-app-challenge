  header: Hubble Telescope
  body: The weather on planets in our solar system and the formation of planets around
    distant stars have both been studied by Hubble. It has studied the makeup of
    the atmospheres of these extrasolar planets, sometimes known as "exoplanets,"
    and may have taken one of the first pictures of one of these worlds in visible
    light.
