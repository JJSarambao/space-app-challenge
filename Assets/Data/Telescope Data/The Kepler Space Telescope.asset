  header: The Kepler Space Telescope
  body: The Kepler Space telescope was developed in the search for planets in the
    universe that potentially harbor extraterrestrial life. When a planet crosses
    one of those stars' paths, a faint dimming is noticed, and the telescope looks
    for it. The telescope has found thousands of planets outside of our solar system
    since it was deployed in 2009.
